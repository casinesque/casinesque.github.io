_To the endless question, what is worth living for, i've always tried to write down a list of gigantic things who i wish to get, but, when i feel down, is because  despite my efforts, i feel too little to achieve them. This is why i'm continuously trying to improve myself trough a wide process of learning, research, studying, practice and mental activity, which together with my curiosity, my passion and my personality, can lead me in give a serious contribute to this world._
