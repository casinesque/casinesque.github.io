<h4>
<strong>Tech</strong>:</h4>
<p>After spending few years as a software engineer where i mostly used to design and implement backend software for
large enterprises with microservices architectures in Java, i shifted my career towards something more challenging
to me, moving on taking care of infrastrcutures and finally start to properly speak devops, cloud and open source.</p>
<p>I'm currently working as a Devops/Cloud Engineer, helping large enterprises to improve, implement, mantain and monitor their production systems based mainly on Kubernetes/Openshift, introducing automation on stale processes by developing custom solutions and through the help of principal devops/cloud open source technologies and concepts, such as IaC, containerization/virtualization, CI/CD, software reliability, monitoring platforms and trying to transmit continuos learning and best practices to customers and collaborators.</p>
<!--I can speak Python, Bash, Kubernetes, Openshift, Ansible and sometimes Italian, english and french. -->

<!--I'm a __Junior Software Architect / Software Engineer__ based in Italy, my daily work is focused on helping large enterprises in improve their internal IT processes hence this can be either means design, analyze and develop cloud-native applications using  microservices architectures and distributed system, or support them in any step of the SDLC. <br> Easily follows that my daily tasks spans from REST API management (development, testing or design) to component integration, to coding backend Springboot applications or to help internal IT people in developing compliant DevOps environments.<br>
The main perks of this job is that gives you a good comprehension of the fundamental technologies which are now used everywhere to provide scalable, reliable and HA platforms or applications such as Kubernetes, Docker and the whole set of related concepts and technologies which are related with the deploy and manteinance of applications.
