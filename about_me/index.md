### __Tech__:
I'm a __Junior Software Architect__ based in Italy, my daily work is focused on project, design, analyze and develop cloud-native applications using  microservices architectures and distributed systems, spanning from REST API management to component integration, and where CI/CD is the norm. The main perk of this job is that it gives you the whole view of the system you are looking at without focusing on just a single component and technology, so you learn and grow faster because among your daily projects there is always something new and you see how stuff really works under the hood. This also highly improve my coding skills which today is the closest thing to magic!
</br>

I have a Master degree in Cyber security computer engineering, and since then i started being strongly passionated by security, mainly _cryptography_ and its _algorithms_, _malware analysis_, _reverse engineering (and all its social aspects)_  and most of all, _blockchain_, topic which i focused during my dissertation (which was then published @Tokenomics 2019 in Paris) and which i  particularly care of. I find human being really interesting and i like to analyze the social behaviours and psycological factors involved in security, like attack vectors or code review, trying to disclose who is hiding at the rear of the lines, and which crumbs he left behind.
