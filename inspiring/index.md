Borrowing Miles Davis quote
>__"Do not play what's there, play what's not there "__

The real portrait of culture in my country. One of the best mind of this time, magnetic as divulgator and well prepared as professor. He spans from history, to math, to philosophy, the living proof that knowledge is circular.

###  __Terry Gilliam__:
I have many favourite film directors but he deserve a special mention. Known as the _"flop movie director"_ as often happens, he is just too mentally far for being comprehended. The only oversea member of the iconic _Monty Python_ his movies as director are milestones in cinema and he represents a complete artist since he often write or sketch. This means being big pictured.
