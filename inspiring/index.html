<p>I've always been fascinated by people who strongly dedicate, time, energies and passion to reach a goal or a project, especially when this aim to bring value to everyone or increase people's life quality or contribute in makes this world spinning on the right side.
Borrowing Miles Davis quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Do not play what's there, play what's not there "</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>i simply love people who create things which first there wasn't.<br>This the list of people which i draw my inspiration from,i follow regularly and i'm completely dedicated and i admire the most. Scientists, writers, netpreneurs, innovators, revolutionaries, you have a special place in my heart. This is just a bunch of people who i wish to share a dinner with ! (and Yes, you can be added to this list too ! )</p>
<h4>
<strong>Moxie Marlinspike</strong>:</h4>
<p>For his way of living and for his deep contributes in security with the Signal protocol providing E2E ecnryption on most popular messaging applications</p>
<h4>
<strong>Lvh</strong>:</h4>
<p>For releasing his <strong>Crypto101</strong>  which back in time i studied with passion ( and i'm still strongly recommend it!)</p>
<h4>
<strong>Edward Snowden</strong>:</h4>
<p>For his courage and integrity in spilling the truth, not caring about the aftermath</p>
<h4>
<strong>Jimmy Wales</strong>:</h4>
<p>For providing people a door on the endless world of knowledge and curiosity</p>
<h4>
<strong>Troy Hunt</strong>:</h4>
<p>His <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> is simply an amazing project and an infinite usefulness tool.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Salvatore Sanfilippo</strong>:</h4>
<p>Not just for being a compatriot of mine, but mainly for the passion and the effort he spent on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBuifhInz7A">Redis</a> and his devotion to Open Source</p>
<!-- ### __Yann Collet__ -->

<h4>
<strong>Guido Van Rossum</strong>:</h4>
<p>The Python creator, no IT person wouldn't love this man</p>
<h4>
<strong>Elon Musk</strong>:</h4>
<p>He definitevly creates something from nothing, skilled, visionary, dreamer,innovateur, never satisfied, what else?</p>
<h4>
<strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>:</h4>
<p>As IT person i can't exclude this God from my list.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Piergiorgio Odifreddi</strong> :</h4>
<p>The real portrait of culture in my country. One of the best mind of this time, magnetic as divulgator and well prepared as professor. He spans from history, to math, to philosophy, the living proof that knowledge is circular.</p>
<h4><strong>Bertrand Russell</strong></h4>
<p>Another amazing mind who walked this world. I really appreciate him for his books and his philosphical thinking</p>
<h4>
<strong>Woody Allen</strong>:</h4>
<p>For any cinema lovers this man is a pure genius. One of my personal idol for his beliefs, his brilliant humour and his way of facing life.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>:</h4>
<p>Together with Satoshi Nakamoto, they get the award as some of the best innovator of all time. Blockahin, Bitcoin and Ethereum  will completely revolutionize the world sooner or later.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Terry Gilliam</strong>:</h4>
<p>I have many favourite film directors but he deserve a special mention. Known as the <em>"flop movie director"</em> as often happens, he is just too mentally far for being comprehended. The only oversea member of the iconic <em>Monty Python</em> his movies as director are milestones in cinema and he represents a complete artist since he often write or sketch. This means being big pictured.</p>
